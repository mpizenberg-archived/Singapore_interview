# Singapore interview

Those web pages contain the documentation of my preparation to an interview for an internship in Singapore.
The work I had to prepare is the following :

1. [Install Eclipse and OpenCV on a Mac/**Linux machine**/virtual machine](install.md)
2. [Extract 10 frames (ideally, 1 frame every second) from a given video of a cat](extraction.md)
3. [Use SEEDS Superpixels algorithm or any suitable algorithm to segment the cat from background](superpixel.md)
4. [Create a boundary box for the segmented cat](box.md)
5. [Document what I did (in a short format)](doc.md)

The repository containing my work is accessible at [https://github.com/mpizenberg/Singapore_interview](https://github.com/mpizenberg/Singapore_interview)
